I will not consider adding features that are too cheaty, pointless or are just unrelated to this module.

IllegalMap is a ChatTriggers module that scans each Dungeon to give extra information to the user, like which rooms and puzzles are in the dungeon and exactly how many secrets there are before the dungeon even starts. The map also shows the user other useful information like the total secrets, death penalties, crypts, mimic and the current score right underneath the map so that the user never needs to look at the tab list. IllegalMap can be used on its own as your primary dungeon map, with significantly more features than any other map currently. IllegalMap is highly customizable through the /dmap command.

Note: Due to Hypixel's render distance limitation, not all of the dungeon will be visible from the starting room.

## Features
## Dungeon Preview
IllegalMap automatically scans the dungeon as soon as you enter it. After the dungeon has been fully scanned (And the chunks all loaded), it will stop scanning.
By default, all of the rooms before the dungeon begins will be shown clearly, but once the dungeon starts all of the unexplored rooms will be darkened so that they can be distinguished from already explored rooms.
There is an option to show room names and secrets all the time in the Config gui (/dmap), however if you want a cleaner looking map it is recommended to use the **"Peek Rooms"** keybind which will only show room names while the key is being held.

## Dungeon Info
IllegalMap shows useful info about the dungeon underneath the map (By default) including found-remaining-total secrets, crypts, minimum secrets (For S+), score pentalty for deaths, the current score and the mimic status (See screenshots from Dungeon Preview).
The dungeon info can also be configured to display seperately from the map, or remain under the map during clear and seperate upon entering boss.

## Star Mob ESP and Radar
Scans for star mobs in the world. Can be configured to have boxes drawn around them in the world, or show their locations on the map as small icons.

The mob heads can be configured to have their border colors changed or just appear as small colored dots.

## Dungeon Logs
IllegalMap logs all of the dungeons that you scan. This lets the user view interesting statistics about the dungeon like the average number of secrets per floor, which puzzles or rooms appear the most (or least) or the average number of wither doors in each dungeon.
The command for Dungeon Logs is **"/dlogsnew \[floor]"**. If no floor is given, then it will show the statistics for every dungeon that you have logged.
The room percentages shown for rooms and puzzles show how the percentage of runs which that room appears in.
